// an app notebook.

// Once authenticated, this flag will indicate whether the app notebook chosen by the user is, in fact, linked.
// (This will never be YES if you have set the flag above to NO). If so, you must take this into account:
// the primary note store will not allow you to access the notebook; instead, you must authenticate to the
// relevant linked notebook. You can find the linked notebook record by calling -listLinkedNotebooks on the
// primary note store.
@property (nonatomic, readonly) BOOL appNotebookIsLinked;

// This give access to the preferences store that the session keeps independently from NSUserDefaults, and is
// destroyed when the session unauthenticates. This should generally not be used in your application, but
// it is used by the sample UIActivity to track recently-used notebook destinations, which are of course
// session-specific. If you use it, please namespace your keys appropriately to avoid collisions.
@property (nonatomic, readonly) ENPreferencesStore * preferences;

// Retrive an appropriate note store client to perform API operations with:
// - The primary note store client is valid for all personal notebooks, and can also be used to authenticate with
//   shared notebooks.
// - The business note store client will only be non-nil if the authenticated user is a member of a business. With
//   it, you can access the business's notebooks.
// - Every linked notebook requires its own note store client instance to access.
